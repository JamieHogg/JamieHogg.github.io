<B>Snake Game</B><BR>
For an assignment for our Low Level Programming Module in my second year of University, we were set the task of recreating the famous game of 'Snake' in ASGE (stands for Awesome Sauce Game Engine). We were given 4 weeks to complete it and were tasked with not only making a basic game of 'Snake', but also to add our on spin on it.

<B>Gameplay</B><BR>
The gameplay is very much what is expected from a 'Snake' game, when the player starts, they control the head of a snake which is constantly moving. As the head of the snake eats red squares in the area, it increases in length and increases the player's points.
