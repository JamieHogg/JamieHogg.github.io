<B>Infinite Runner Game</B><BR>
One of the assignments whilst I was doing my second year of University was to create an infinite runner style game. It was to be made in ASGE (stands for Awesome Sauce Game Engine) same as the 'Snake Game' made previously. We were given once again 4 weeks to make an infinite runner with freedom as to how it looks and how we wanted to do it as long as it had the core aspects which make an infinite runner.
