#### Summer Modeling and Unreal Practice
During the Summer between the first and second year of University, I decided to practice some modeling using Maya, the same software used to make the 3D Planet Orrery made the previous year. In the end I decided to try and recreate Otonokizaka High School from the anime show 'Love Live! School Idol Project' due to the nice designs of the building and actually having images to go base off.

All the objects were made in the software 'Autodesk Maya' before being exported and imported into Unreal. Originally it was going to be all made in Maya before being imported over to the ‘Unreal 4 Engine’. This was because Maya became too laggy due to all the objects. Also Unreal was going to be used in the second year so some experience with it I felt could be useful.

The progress so far is only the front of the building, this is due to lack of images for reference to the sides and it taking around 2 weeks just to do the front. This was a result of numerous redesigning of some of the objects which I wasn't satisfied with.
