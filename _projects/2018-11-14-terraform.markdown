<B>Overview</B><BR>
'Terraform' was another Game Jam style game in which we were only given 2 weeks to complete. The task was to create a game based around a randomly generate theme. The theme our group was given was "A horror game where you taunt tunnels with terraforming". Aswell as sticking to the theme given, we were given other mandatory criteria such as it being made in 3D, having atleast some procedural generation and to have shown a strong focus on juice and fizz.

<B>What was Achieved?</B><BR>
Given the theme and criteria, we created an escape style maze in which the player must destroy obsticles to move forward. The player must roam the randomly generated map whilst going back to the starting position to pick up gas canisters which are used to destroy the blockades. This alongside a rising water level causes for an intense claustrophobic experience in which the player is searching for the exit but losing oxygen and getting lost. Flares were added to help players find their way back to spawn as all the rooms and tunnels look alike.
