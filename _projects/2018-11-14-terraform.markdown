<B>Overview</B><BR>
'Terraform' was another Game Jam style game where we were only given 2 weeks to complete it. The task was to create a game based around a randomly generate theme. The theme our group was given was "A horror game where you taunt tunnels with terraforming". Aswell as sticking to the theme given, we we given other mandatory criteria such as it being made in 3D, having atleast some procedural generation and to have shown a strong focus on juice and fizz.
