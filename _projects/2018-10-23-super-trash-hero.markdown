<B>Overview</B><BR>
'Super Trash Heroes' was a Game Jam project which was focused around the theme of recycling. It started of as side scrolling beat-em up game similar to 1989s 'Final Fight'. In the same group used to make 'Shadow of Atari', we were tasked with using the existing assets within the game to create a completely new game, however we were required to keep the theme of recycling.

<B>What was Achieved?</B><BR>
We ended up deciding to create a competitive multiplayer styled recycling game.
Players (of up to 4) would compete against each other to throw trash into their personal trucks to gain points. The trash was gained by breaking trash bags spat out of an enemy garbage truck constantly each round (Each game consisted of 4 rounds). Fruit could also be dropped by trash bags when broken though would cause the player to lose points when thrown into their personal truck.

There was also a competitive fighting aspect to the game, this was in which players could knock out other players to make them respawn and not be able to score points for a short period of time. Hitting a player's truck a set number of times would also cause the last item they had thrown in to be spat back out and take points from them. At the end of the 4 rounds, the player with the most points was the winner.
