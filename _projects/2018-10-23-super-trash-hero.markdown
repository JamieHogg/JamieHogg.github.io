<B>Overview</B><BR>
'Super Trash Heroes' was a Game Jam project which was focused around the theme of recycling. It started of as side scrolling beat-em up game similar to 1989s 'Final Fight'. In the same group used to make 'Shadow of Atari', we were tasked with using the existing assets within the game to create a completely new game, however we were required to keep the theme of recycling.
