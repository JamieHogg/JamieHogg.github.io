<B>Overview</B><BR>
This project was one out of three task for a final year module called 'Advanced Technologies' during the third year of my Games Technology degree. We were tasked with create a program capabale of creating building models using 'OpenGL' or 'DirectX11/12'. These created buildings designed in the program by users were to be able to be exported then imported into other programs for use.

<B>What was Achieved?</B><BR>
The chosen programming interface for the task was DirectX11 AND C++. After a square was rendered, it was soon turned into a cube which was used as the basis of the buildings by creating 'Minecraft' style buildings out of them. 
Using the 'AntTweakBar' GUI, the player was eventually able to:
- Change the width down each side
- Change the cube's textures
- Add/remove windows
- Add/remove the roof of the building
  
Each building created can be exported at the press of a button into a '.obj' file which then can be imported into another program such as 'Unity'.
