<B>Overview</B><BR>
This game started its life as a Game Jam creation by the company PlayWest, it is Bomberman inspired game which allows for up to 64 players. 
As Game Jam games are created in only 48 hours, it was far from complete and ridden with tons of bugs.
It was set as our cohort task during our final year to work together and fix the game along with improving it.
The different elements to create and fix for the project were split up between the different teams within the cohort.
Our team was tasked with implementing an unused plane vehicle, this meant programming the different behaviours and a new game mode for the plane. 

<B>Theories which were used:</B>
- Newton's Law of Universal Gravity
- Kepler's Law of Planetary Motion
- Conic Sections
- Hook's Law
- Hill Sphere

<B>End Result</B><BR>
The final product was a UI based system which allowed the user to create a solar system whilst also allowing them to tweak it to their own preferences.
