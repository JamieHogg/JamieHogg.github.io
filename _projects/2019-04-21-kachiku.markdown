<B>Overview</B><BR>
This game started its life as a Game Jam creation by the company PlayWest, it is a 'Bomberman' inspired game which allows for up to 64 players. 
As Game Jam games are created in only 48 hours, it was far from complete and ridden with tons of bugs.
It was set as our cohort task during our final year to work together and fix the game along with improving it.
The different elements to create and fix for the project were split up between the different teams within the cohort.
Our team was tasked with implementing an unused plane vehicle, this meant programming the different behaviours and a new game mode for the plane. 

<B>What was Achieved?</B><BR>
By the completetion of the project, we had succesfully added a stable plane to its own game mode. This including new custom maps made by our team using the new level editor to show off and highlight the plane's abilities.
The planes were given a few different features which took some consideration before adding to make sure they were balanced.
Some features included:
- Dropping bombs
- Shooting in front
- Taking off & landing
- A fuel system
