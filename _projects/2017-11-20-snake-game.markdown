<B>Snake Game</B><BR>
For an assignment for our Low-Level Programming Module in my second year of University, we were set the task of recreating the famous game of 'Snake' in ASGE (stands for Awesome Sauce Game Engine). We were given 4 weeks to complete it and were tasked with not only making a basic game of 'Snake', but also to add our own spin on it.

<B>Gameplay</B><BR>
The gameplay is very much what is expected from a 'Snake' game, when the player starts, they control the head of a snake which is constantly moving. As the head of the snake eats 'Red' squares in the area, it increases in length and increases the player's points. If the player however hits their tail which follows behind them or the border of the game, it will end in a 'Game Over'.

<B>Unique Aspect</B><BR>
The significant difference made in this compared to the original 'Snake' was the concept of health. As time went on, the player's health would continue to go down. If the player's health reached zero, it would also cause a 'Game Over'. To prevent this, other than just having a 'Red' square to eat to increase in length, they had to eat a 'Blue' square also to keep their health above zero.
