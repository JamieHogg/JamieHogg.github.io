<B>Birdman's Break-in</B><BR>
For our 3rd assignment in Low-Level Programming at University in my second year, we were tasked with watching a movie then coming up with a game based around it. The movie we had to use was the Oscar winner 'Birdman' released back in 2014. We were given free reign with what the game would be, in the end we decided on doing an 'Escape the Room' styled game.

The scene from the movie that gave us the idea was where the main character, Riggan gets locked out of the theatre and then tries to despreately get back into the theatre. He eventually has to walk through Times Square in nothing but his socks and underwear.
