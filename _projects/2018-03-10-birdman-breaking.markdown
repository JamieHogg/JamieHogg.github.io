<B>Birdman's Break-in</B><BR>
For our 3rd assignment in Low-Level Programming at University in my second year, we were tasked with watching a movie then coming up with a game based around it. The movie we had to use was the Oscar winner 'Birdman' released back in 2014. It also had to be made in ASGE. We were given free reign with what the game would be, in the end we decided on doing an 'Escape the Room' styled game. Unlike the other two previous games we were tasked to make in ASGE, this time we were put into groups of 3-4. Mine was a group of 3 and we all worked on the game to make it easier to complete. I did 90% of the art assets used in the game (which can be seen above) and helped with a lot of the scene related code.

The scene from the movie that gave us the idea was where the main character, Riggan gets locked out of the theatre and then tries to despreately get back into the theatre. He eventually has to walk through Times Square in nothing but his socks and underwear.
  
<B>Gameplay</B><BR>
The game is very similar to the old 'Monkey Island' games by 'LucasArts' in terms of them both being point and click. It doesn't use arrow keys, it's all done with the mouse clicks at the different positions on the game screen that move the player across the scene and allow them to interact with the game's objects.
