<B>Personal Creative Project</B><BR>
In my final year on the Games Tech course, we were tasked with choosing a personal project about a topic of interest outside or beyond the modules taught to us. After recently playing both 'Gravity Rush' & 'Gravity Rush 2', I was captivated by the abnormal use of Gravity. So the topic of interest to undertake was gravity within the game engine Unity.
  
It was decided that the best ways of showing off Gravity within the engine would be to create a solar system simulation. This would show how gravity works and also test the possibilities when using real life theories inside the engine.

<B>Theories which were used:</B>
- Newton's Law of Universal Gravity
- Kepler's Law of Planetary Motion
- Conic Sections
- Hook's Law
- Hill Sphere

<B>End Result</B><BR>
The final product was a UI based system which allowed the user to create a solar system whilst also allowing them to tweak it to their own preferences.
