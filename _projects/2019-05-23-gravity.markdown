<B>Personal Creative Project</B><BR>
In the third year Games Tech course, we were tasked with choosing a personal project to choose a topic of interest outside or beyond the modules taught to us. After recently playing both 'Gravity Rush' & 'Gravity Rush 2', I was captivated by the abnormal use of Gravity. So the topic of interest to undertake was gravity within the game engine Uniity.
  
It was decided that the best ways of showing off Gravity within the engine would be to create a solar system simulation. This would show how gravity works and also test the possibilities when using real life theories inside the engine.

Theories which were used:
- Newton's Law of Universal Gravity
- Kepler's Law of Planetary Motion
- Conic Sections
- Hook's Law
- Hill Sphere

<B>End Result</B><BR>
The Final product was a UI based system which allowed the user to create a solar system and tweak it to their own preferences.
