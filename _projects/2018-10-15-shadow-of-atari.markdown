<B>Overview</B><BR>
'Shadow of Atari' was a game jam style project in which we were tasked in groups with recreating a modern game IP as if it had been released for the Atari 2600. The Atari 2600 being a 70s console, the project was meant challenge us by giving us limitations of what is actually possible. It was also to see what these games might have looked like when released in the past.

We chose to recreate the 2005 game, 'Shadow of the Colossus' as we felt the boss aspect of the original could be nicely recreated in the Atari 2600 style.
  
<B>What was Achieved?</B><BR>
Due to the limitations put in place, we created a very simplistic game in which the player has to scale up a colossus, hit its weak spots to kill it. A stamina meter was implemented which will through the player off when climbing a colossus if it runs out. Conveniently placed platforms help for players to regain stamina as they climb whilst avoiding obsticles sucha as a colossus's arm.
2 bosses were implemented in the given time frame, a flying and non flying varient.
