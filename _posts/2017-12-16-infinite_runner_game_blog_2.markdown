After completing the infinite runner and having it marked, despite it being a 'Pass', it was severely 
lacking and had a lot of problems. The problems were mainly though caused due to lack of time to do the game.
We were also given a month but it ran alongside another assignment which used up all of my time, so little was spent on this game until the other was done.

The biggest problem was the collision. Since for the collision the player's rect had to be compared to others, it had issues. The platforms only seemed to work 50% of the time, plus a feature included to force the gravity back on the player once leaving a platform ruined the game a bit. This is due to the fact I combined platforms to create bigger ones, this caused the player to fall off in the middle of some of the bigger platforms.

Another problem was that a jump limit wasn't implemented. Since the whole idea is for the player to last as long as possible, the infinite jumping just made the game really easy. It was compared to 'Flappy Bird' which was an infinite runner type game with infinite jumping, but it wasn't intentional.

Overall it could've been improved a lot if more time was available and given to the making of it.
