During these past few weeks, our group currently named "Wicked Wango Games" have been meeting up most Fridays (If not the Sunday) to discuss our game.

Since the board game has to be based on a cultural, political or economic issue which is current or atleast in the past few years. Basically not something about the World Wars for example. Since I don't read the news or know much about this sort of stuff I wasn't too helpful, however we did some research online by looking at news articles on sites such as BBC for inspiration.
One of the article's that popped out which gave us an idea for 1 of our games was was an article about in Wales having a minimum price for alcohol. The idea for the game that came up was a world where alcohol had been outlawed.

This game idea became the basic premise for the board game we started to design and come up with since we couldn't come up with anything better and thought it was quite a good idea. To put it simply, the player would control a gang who would make and sell alcohol on the black market.

The idea was that the players would be working against other gangs trying to make money selling illegal alcohol on the black market. Each player would play as their own seperate gang and the player at the end with the most money would obviously be the winner. This was a more desireable approach than the previous in which everyone was working together against the goverment. We decided that it didn't sound too fun so added more a more competetive feel to the game. 
Event cards were an idea added to the game, these would be played at the start of each round (simply once everyone has had a turn and it's the first person's turn again). An example of an event card would be that sales for a certain beverage would be increased. They don't overly effect the game drastically but adds a bit more to the currently linear game. An event card was also how we intend the game to end, the end game card would be place in the last quater of the deck and end the game when used.
Negottiations were also a feature we decided to add to the game to make it slightly more interesting. Trading wasn't that simple though as the player's had the option double cross the other player. If both players used double cross, both gained nothing. If one used double cross, they gain everything. But if both didn't double cross then both get the resources that they got from the negotiation.
Lastly we thought of adding an auction for better machinery, this would increase the production of their alcohol produce per turn. Also every player is able to auction for it.

Since we decided to do this as our board game idea for now, we must perfect the rules and present it to get feedback.
