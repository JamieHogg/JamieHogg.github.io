A lot has progressed since last time.

<B>Classes/Characters</B><BR>
There is now a class select in the lobby allowing the player to select their desired pawns for the game.
It also includes a lock mode to lock the ability to select pawns which is needed to start the game, similar to a 'ready up'.
All the attack types work, both melee and ranged work perfectly and actually damage the chosen target.
With the range attacks, the projectiles actually go from the selected pawn to the selected enemy pawn before damaging them.
The arrows also go in the right angle of the enemy they are going towards.
Damage also is effected via a strong against class system.

<B>It is as follows:</B>
  - Warrior -> Assassin
  - Archer -> Lancer
  - Mage -> Archer
  - Lancer -> Warrior
  - Assassin -> Mage

This adds incentive to use specific classes against others and adds more to the game.

<B>In Game Chat</B><BR>
Currently, in the lobby, a chatbox is available which allows the user to type and send messages into the lobby chat. Currently though it doesn't send over the network so is only present in the play who sent it's lobby chat.

<B>Things Left to do:</B>
- Fix the bug where the pawns sometimes have the wrong team's texture
