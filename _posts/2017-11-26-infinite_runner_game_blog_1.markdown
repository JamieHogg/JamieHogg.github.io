For the second game tasked to be created in ASGE, we are meant to separately create an infinite runner game. 
So, in a sense, a game similar to the 2011 popular mobile game 'Temple runner' in which the player gains point as they progress and avoids obstacles.

<B>New Scenes</B>
For this task there are quite a few different requirements which have been set. Firstly, as opposed to just a game scene, there are also 2 more different scenes for the player to move between. A start menu and a game over screen is to be added. 
The start menu could be useful though as the main menu in games tends to hold ability etc.
A game over scene would just be nice to have as its own thing for displaying what score the player got.

<B>Leaderboards</B>
Leaderboards give players a higher incentive to play and goals to strive for or to overcome. They add more challenge and can cause more enjoyment. So, adding a leaderboards system to check how fast you are is a big positive. The best method I can think of it to display and update the leaderboards is via setting all the data in text files then reading them to get the data back. So essentially, when a high score is beaten, the lowest high score will be deleted and all the scores lower than the new scores will then be moved down the list. What could be difficult though is just reading and setting the data in the text files.
  
<B>Procedural Level</B>
The level will be procedural by having the platforms and obstacles that come towards the player spawn in random positions before entering the window's area and then randomly spawning back on the spawn side once going fully across the scene. This then will always create a game which is constantly being randomly changed all the time so that no two runs are exactly the same.
