Since the last blog post, where I had only just finished/worked out the movement for the snake sprite, I have achieved a lot which also isn't much at all. 

Movement
Firstly, I wanted to make the sprite move a specific number of spaces each time it moved like the classic versions of snake. I also realized that it would just make coding everything excessively easier as the collision can be solved by the head part of the sprite just being equal to the target.
