This post is post the 1 on 1 review session with James. I managed to pass, unfortunately it was only barely a pass which I was disappointed with, but a pass is a pass. In this post I will go over what happened and why I was close to failing.

<b>Wait Function</b><BR>
So the big thing that screwed me over in this assingment was my wait function. As soon as I went into the session, James straight away said it was unplayable. In my opinion, that is incorrect as I played it myself and knew it wasn't perfect but it run and felt at the time that it was good enough. The problem was that the function I used pretty much slowed down the game to make the sprite move slower. This isn't really good as it messes up the inputs also, for example I'd input a direction, then it would take a short time for the game to take the input and act on it.
James said I should've asked him about the wait function in one of the lessons, but from my point of view I didn't know it was that bad so didn't think I needed to ask about it so didn't.
Anyways I was apparently meant to use delta time instead so will use it for the next game which is an infinite runner.
  
<b>Structure</b><BR>
The other big thing that slightly ruined my assignment was my code stucture. It was only after James started marking it that I realized how bad it actually was. In functions I would have tons and tons of code when some of it should really have just been within seperate functions. This was a justified fault that'd I'd agree with since my code was barely understandable, even I had problems understamding it.

<b>Commenting</b><BR>
A small thing that I did badly was some of the commenting. In a panic to try and follow the coding style, I commented as much as I could within the code. This wasn't the best as I had commented in some locations where commenting was just illogical as the code was obvious as to what it did.

<b>Conclusion</b><BR>
Overall, I'm proud of what I have achieved in the time that I had, I probably should've started ealrier and spent more time on it. I did have a lot of problems but that also means I have a lot to improve on and show that I have improved for next time.
