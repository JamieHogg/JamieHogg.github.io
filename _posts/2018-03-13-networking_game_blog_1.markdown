For the final group assignment, we were tasked with making a turn-based game which works over a network. 
This basically meaning having to send packets of data containing the current game session's data to the server and between each client.

After descussion, the game concept came up was a fantasy type game similar to 'Heroes of Might and Magic' in which there are classes such as 
Warrior, Archer, etc on board which can attack enemies and move to other places on the board.
