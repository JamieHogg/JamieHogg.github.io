Today we got the framework for the second game for this module of the course.
It has been given a deadline of November the 8th which is just over a month a way meaning we have a short time to make it.
Luckily we aren't having to do this in COCOS2D-X this year which I'm honestly glad with since I didn’t really like it in the first year, however we are apparently using an engine called ASGE (Also known as Awesome Source Game Engine) instead.
This engine was apparently made by the teacher, James which is cool however makes it so that we can’t easily use google for help.
It is honestly a very good idea since it makes it so we have to think more for ourselves and gives us experience in working with an engine we are unfamiliar with which we be helpful for the future. Doesn’t mean I’m happy about it though as I know it is going to be a challenge and don’t really know where to start.
It didn’t sound as bad until I heard that it was worse than COCOS2D-X which I honestly struggled with.
Before I even start anything I think I’ll have to try and get my head around the functions and stuff already in the given code and work from there.
The probably best option in my opinion will probably be to get a square rendering in then getting it to move across the screen then carry on from there. 

Since we are meant to add extras after making the basics of the game, I think a few things I will try to add to the game will include:
- Power-ups
- Multiplayer
- Settings
All these are just thoughts right now but I will try to implement them if I can.
