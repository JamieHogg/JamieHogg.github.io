Today we got the framework for the second game for this module of the course.
It has been given a deadline of November the 8th which is a Wednesday and honestly isn't a very long time away.
Luckily we aren't having to do this in COCOS2D-X this year which I'm honestly glad with but apparently Awesome Source Game Engine instead.
Sounded fine until I heard it was worse than COCOS2D-X which I honestly struggled with.
Basically before even starting I will attempt to research how to use this new engine.
Things I will try to add to the game may include power-ups, multiplayer, scoreboard etc.
