For this second year of University, for the first assignment in the module Low Level Programming, 
we have been given the task with making the classic game 'Snake'. This will be made in the programming 
language 'C++' prgramming language, however using 'ASGE' (Also known as Awesome Sauce Game Engine) which 
is provided to us. Other than make a basic game of 'Snake', it is also meant to incorpriate some other 
feature which makes it unique.

<B>Unique Feature Ideas</B><BR>
- Make it into a game similar to 'Tron' and make it multiplayer
- Add a speed and slowdown boost pick-up for added difficulty and make the game easier
- Add a health bar which slowly goes down over time and only goes back up via a power-up
- Have obsticles for the player to avoid
