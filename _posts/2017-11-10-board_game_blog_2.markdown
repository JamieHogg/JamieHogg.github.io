After having our group presentation on our board game idea, it was not positively recieved unfortunately. A lot of the mechanics were apparently nice however the big problem was the theme for our board game. The whole idea behind alcohol being outlawed was not a theme which people liked. People didn't really like it since it seemed to put across a "Alcohol should be outlawed" kind of message which wasn't something people agreed with. We hadn't really thought about how people playing the game would feel about the game.
The game was also compared to another game which it was apparently quite similar to.

This showed us that we really needed to re-think our whole game and try to make it more unique and think of a new theme. Originally we couldn't think of many new ideas and the best option we originally had was to just change the theme from alcohol to drugs since then we could put across the message that "Drugs are bad". This however didn't solve our other problems of how the game was similar to other games so we had to come up with something else.

A few ideas that came up were to do with the deep web and hacking but decided against that. We found that a lot of news articles, especially last year were about independence referendums after the famous Brexit vote back in June of 2016. This gave us the idea to come up with a idea based on political idependence. It was also still really current as the state of Catalonia in Spain recently declared independence from the rest of Spain not to long ago.
