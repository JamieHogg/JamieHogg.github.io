For this current game assignment, the task is to work in groups to make a game based on the Oscar winning movie, 'Birdman' using 'ASGE'.
Our group came up with a couple ideas for the game. One of the ideas was where the player must manage the actor Edward Norton due to the movie exenterating the fact he has reputation for being difficult to work with.  Another idea was a rhythm game, a beat-em up and a point and click puzzle game.

The point and click puzzle idea is the one we chose and fleshed out after much discussion. We decided it would be:
- 8-bit styled as it's a lot easier to do the art for and looks nice.
- Isometric viewpoint to give an easier view the map and traverse it.
- Not too simple to add some challenge.
- A timer to give more incentives to do it fast and give a sense of urgency.

The elevated pitches were met with decent response apart from the isometric viewpoint idea for the game which was met with negative responses. The points made were that it would just be difficult to do, plus it just seemed better to do 2D since itâ€™d probably be better anyways.
