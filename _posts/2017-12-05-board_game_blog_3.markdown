After having the final presentation the other day, we have really fleshed out to a decent standard. We got our board game play tested at the university's board game society to get their opinions. It went down well and they seemed to think it was quite an enjoyable game, they even said it wasn't too similar to any games they have played before meaning it's probably quite original. 

We got some really good feedback from it, for example apparently some of the cards were a bit hard to understand or didn't really make too much sense. For example the main one was the action card which allowed you to "Ignore the event card". People had problems with it since they didn't know when to use it since most the event cards are actually good making it quite pointless. This was obviously something we had accidently forgot to change back when the event cards were more negative.

Overall the game was well received, we just need to change up and correct a few things and play test in preparation for the play session.
