After having our group presentation on our board game idea, it was not positively received unfortunately. A lot of the mechanics were apparently nice however the big problem was the theme for our board game. The whole idea behind alcohol being outlawed was not a theme which people liked. People didn't really like it since it seemed to put across a "Alcohol should be outlawed" kind of message which wasn't something people agreed with. We hadn't really thought about how people playing the game would feel about the game.
The game was also compared to another game which it was apparently quite similar to.

This showed us that we really needed to re-think our whole game and try to make it more unique and think of a new theme. Originally we couldn't think of many new ideas and the best option we originally had was to just change the theme from alcohol to drugs since then we could put across the message that "Drugs are bad". This however did not solve our other problems of how the game was similar to other games so we had to come up with something else.

A few ideas that came up were to do with the deep web and hacking but decided against that. We found that a lot of news articles, especially last year were about independence referendums after the famous Brexit vote back in June of 2016. This gave us the idea to come up with a idea based on political independence. It was also still really current as the state of Catalonia in Spain recently declared independence from the rest of Spain not to long ago.

When switching to this theme we tried to think of all the mechanics which we could take from 'Black Liquid' and bring over to this new game which we appropriately named 'Independence'. In the end we kept the resources but changed them slightly to policies, plus also decided to keep the action cards and event cards. We wanted to keep the negotiations but it just wouldn't fit with the game we were trying to make unfortunately.

In the end, the game we came up with plays as follows. Each player starts with a meter from 0 to 20 and 4 paper clips in yellow, blue, green and red. The paper clips represent the player's policy score and by default is set to 10. Yellow is morale, blue is leadership, red is pride and green is wealth. Each player also start with 5 action cards in hand and 3 action points. When a new round starts an event card is set for the round along with the policy values, then the first player starts their turn. The player can use their 3 action points freely on using an action card's action, picking up a new card (unless they already have 5), taking a policy (which is the new resource, 1 for each policy type) or enacting a policy. Enacting a policy can't be enacted the round it was gained though. The last thing a player can do on their turn is use the second action card's use, this takes away policy points from a chosen other player.

We need to test all this to find any problems so will be doing game tests and have people test the game.
